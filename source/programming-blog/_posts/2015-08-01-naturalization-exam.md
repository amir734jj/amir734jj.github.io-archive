I believe it is not practical to go to an exam without proper studying and major part of any study is to look over sample questions or previous exams. As a person who was going to take a naturalization exam, which is a exam that I needed to pass in order to become U.S. citizen after five years of waiting. It is an important exam for any green card holder. It is a major step forward. While studying the preparation handbook, I felt the need of a website that uses scoring system to make the learning more enjoyable (gamification). A website that simplifies the learning and make it more efficient. I could not find such a website on the web. Hence, I wrote my own. I used "free to download" audio and photos from USCIS website and created a data structure of them to present to user. In addition, I used SQLite to create a simple to use database of users and their scores.
