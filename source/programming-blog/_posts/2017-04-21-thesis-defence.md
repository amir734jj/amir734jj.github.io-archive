Yesterday, I defended my M.S. Thesis. My committee members ([Dr.  Lingfeng Wang](https://uwm.edu/engineering/people/wang-ph-d-lingfeng/) and [Dr. Adrian Dumitrescu](https://uwm.edu/engineering/people/dumitrescu-ph-d-adrian/)) were helpful. Thesis presentation was 45 minutes and 10 minutes questions. In the end, I was congratulated by my advisor ([Dr. Guangwu Xu](https://uwm.edu/engineering/people/xu-ph-d-guangwu/)) and committee members. My [presentation](/assets/files/supplemental/(long) Thesis_presentation.pdf) and Thesis ([short version](/assets/files/supplemental/(short) Thesis.pdf), [long version](/assets/files/supplemental/(long) Thesis.pdf)) is available here.
